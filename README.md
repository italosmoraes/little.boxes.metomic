### Potential improvements
--------------------------

- separate the `parcelsCostResolver` into more specialized functions as per each business rule added, instead of cramping it all within the same function
- improve the `getParcelCostItem` function to be a bit more explicity about the way the comparisons are being run
- unless we are dealing in tons, the `maxDimension` limit of 9999 works fine but could be re-thought
